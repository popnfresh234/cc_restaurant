# CC's Restaurant Website

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine by running

```
$ git clone https://github.com/popnfresh234/cc_restaurant.git
```

Next, install the required Node modules by running

```
$ npm install
```

To run the website locally run

## Adding features

To add a feature to the website first create and checkout a new branch using the following format

```
feat/{your_feature_name}

```

```
$ git checkout -b feat/{your_feature_name}
```

Make desired changes.  All changes can be added to git via the following:

```
$ git add .
```

Once changes have been added to git they can be committed

```
$ git commit -m "{Your commit message here}"
```

Finally push the feature branch to github by entering

```
$ git push --set-upstream origin feat/{your_feature_name}
```
and following the directions there.

Following this proceed to merge the branch on Github, the administrator will then review your merge request and approve or deny.

After the branch has been merged you can checkout the master branch again and update it

```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
```

Finally, you can delete your local copy of the feature branch if you are finished working on it

```
$ git branch -d feat/{your_feature_name}
```

## Bug fixes

The process for fixes is similar, naming convention for a fix branch is as follows:

```
fix/{fix_name}
```

The process looks like the following:

```
$ git checkout -b fix/{fix_name}
```

Make necessary fixes to code, then:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "{your commit message}"
$ git push --set-upstream origin fix/{fix_name}
```

Make a merge request on Github, after it is approved and merged to master you can update local master and delete local fix branch:

```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git branch -d fix/{fix_name}
```
